IT ISN'T HEAVY I'VE GOT ALL MY WORLDLY GOODS IN IT BUT IT ISN'T HEAVY AND IF IT ISN'T CARRIED IN JUST A CERTAIN WAY THE HANDLE PULLS OUT SO I'D BETTER KEEP IT BECAUSE I KNOW THE EXACT KNACK OF IT IT'S AN EXTREMELY OLD CARPET BAG OH I'M VERY GLAD YOU'VE COME EVEN IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO SLEEP IN A WILD CHERRY TREE
